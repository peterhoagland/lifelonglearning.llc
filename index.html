                                    <span class="blockquote-text">To say that our son's work with Kristel was life-changing is not an exaggeration.  His confidence and skills in both school and life in general have skyrocketed!  It has been so wonderful to see his transformation. He is handling things now that would've been impossible for him before this program.  Our son had some behavioral challenges that at times made him easily irritable and hard to work with.  Kristel was absolutely wonderful with him… She was so patient, kind, supportive and encouraging of him.   Because of a move, we had to switch from meeting with Kristel in person to meeting over Zoom, and the transition was painless, effective and efficient. I cannot recommend Kristel and her program enough! You will not be disappointed!</span>

                                    <span class="blockquote-text">The time our high school-aged daughter spent in Cognitive Development Instruction with Mrs. Knauss has been priceless.  After years of feeling ill-equipped in our homeschooling journey due to an undiagnosed learning disability, Kristel’s assistance was just what we needed to get started on a good track to embark on the final years of school with our daughter. Kristel’s ability to be able to target the now diagnosed disability, her patience, and her kindness allowed our daughter to feel comfortable learning new and different things that could have potentially been deemed as childish. Kristel engaged her like a capable young lady (with lots of laughs)  and never made her feel like there was something wrong with her. We spent years trying different methods to help our daughter memorize her multiplication facts to no avail. Within just a few weeks of consistent practice of the method Kristel implemented not only did she have many facts memorized with confidence, she could also name from memory all 46 Presidents of the United States. After her time with Mrs. Knauss, our daughter’s self-confidence in so many other areas has left us truly delighted.  She has started experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and she requests to play family “brain” games.  She signed up to play rec soccer even though she had never played a sport in her life.  It has been such a blessing to watch her come out of her shell and know that without a doubt she believes she will be able to accomplish anything she puts her mind to.</span>
